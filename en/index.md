            <p>
            Alvatal focuses efforts of businesses, non-profit organizations,
            and volunteers in the pursuit of transparent software and
            hardware solutions.
            It is important for us that mainstream software would be
            open-source in order to guarantee user's freedom of choice and
            sustainability of software solutions in Estonia.
            We also emphasize the importance of same aspects regarding
            computer hardware, so third parties wouldn't have the opportunity
            to tap into user's text messages, e-mails, audio- or videocalls.

            <p>
            Within Europe Estonia still remains one of the affordable
            places to organize meetings and conferences.
            In 2012 we hosted Akademy which was one of the biggest
            open-source conferences held in Estonia.
            We have facilities to host conferences for up to 400 persons.

              <p>
              In 2014 Estonia was the first country in the world to offer
              e-residence for foreigners.
              All e-residents get electronic identity tokens which they 
              can use to autheticate online and sign legally binding documents.
              Estonian e-residents enjoy doing business within European Union
              in a simplified manner avoiding the usual paperwork.
